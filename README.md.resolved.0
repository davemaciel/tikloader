# TikTok Downloader (Local Clone)

This is a local version of a TikTok video downloader that mimics the functionality of online services like SSSTik.

## How it works
1. acts as a proxy server running on your machine.
2. It fetches the necessary session tokens from the download service.
3. It sends the video link to get the "clean" video URL (direct from TikTok's servers).
4. It presents them in a nice UI.

## How to run
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run `npm install` (Already done for you!).
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Troubleshooting
If it stops working, the service might have updated their protection (Cloudflare, etc.). This is a proof-of-concept.
